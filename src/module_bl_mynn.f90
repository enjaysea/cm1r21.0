!WRF:MODEL_LAYER:PHYSICS
!
! translated from NN f77 to F90 and put into WRF by Mariusz Pagowski
! NOAA/GSD & CIRA/CSU, Feb 2008
! changes to original code:
! 1. code is 1D (in z)
! 2. no advection of TKE, covariances and variances 
! 3. Cranck-Nicholson replaced with the implicit scheme
! 4. removed terrain dependent grid since input in WRF in actual
!    distances in z[m]
! 5. cosmetic changes to adhere to WRF standard (remove common blocks, 
!            intent etc)
!-------------------------------------------------------------------
!Modifications implemented by Joseph Olson and Jaymes Kenyon NOAA/GSD/MDB - CU/CIRES
!
! Departures from original MYNN (Nakanish & Niino 2009)
! 1. Addition of BouLac mixing length in the free atmosphere.
! 2. Changed the turbulent mixing length to be integrated from the
!    surface to the top of the BL + a transition layer depth.
! v3.4.1:    Option to use Kitamura/Canuto modification which removes 
!            the critical Richardson number and negative TKE (default).
!            Hybrid PBL height diagnostic, which blends a theta-v-based
!            definition in neutral/convective BL and a TKE-based definition
!            in stable conditions.
!            TKE budget output option (bl_mynn_tkebudget)
! v3.5.0:    TKE advection option (bl_mynn_tkeadvect)
! v3.5.1:    Fog deposition related changes.
! v3.6.0:    Removed fog deposition from the calculation of tendencies
!            Added mixing of qc, qi, qni
!            Added output for wstar, delta, TKE_PBL, & KPBL for correct 
!                   coupling to shcu schemes  
! v3.8.0:    Added subgrid scale cloud output for coupling to radiation
!            schemes (activated by setting icloud_bl =1 in phys namelist).
!            Added WRF_DEBUG prints (at level 3000)
!            Added Tripoli and Cotton (1981) correction.
!            Added namelist option bl_mynn_cloudmix to test effect of mixing
!                cloud species (default = 1: on). 
!            Added mass-flux option (bl_mynn_edmf, = 1 for DMP mass-flux, 0: off).
!                Related options: 
!                 bl_mynn_edmf_mom = 1 : activate momentum transport in MF scheme
!                 bl_mynn_edmf_tke = 1 : activate TKE transport in MF scheme
!            Added mixing length option (bl_mynn_mixlength, see notes below)
!            Added more sophisticated saturation checks, following Thompson scheme
!            Added new cloud PDF option (bl_mynn_cloudpdf = 2) from Chaboureau
!                and Bechtold (2002, JAS, with mods) 
!            Added capability to mix chemical species when env variable
!                WRF_CHEM = 1, thanks to Wayne Angevine.
!            Added scale-aware mixing length, following Junshi Ito's work
!                Ito et al. (2015, BLM).
! v3.9.0    Improvement to the mass-flux scheme (dynamic number of plumes,
!                better plume/cloud depth, significant speed up, better cloud
!                fraction). 
!            Added Stochastic Parameter Perturbation (SPP) implementation.
!            Many miscellaneous tweaks to the mixing lengths and stratus
!                component of the subgrid clouds.
! v.4.0      Removed or added alternatives to WRF-specific functions/modules
!                for the sake of portability to other models.
!                the sake of portability to other models.
!            Further refinement of mass-flux scheme from SCM experiments with
!                Wayne Angevine: switch to linear entrainment and back to
!                Simpson and Wiggert-type w-equation.
!            Addition of TKE production due to radiation cooling at top of 
!                clouds (proto-version); not activated by default.
!            Some code rewrites to move if-thens out of loops in an attempt to
!                improve computational efficiency.
!            New tridiagonal solver, which is supposedly 14% faster and more
!                conservative. Impact seems very small.
!            Many miscellaneous tweaks to the mixing lengths and stratus
!                component of the subgrid-scale (SGS) clouds.
! v4.1       Big improvements in downward SW radiation due to revision of subgrid clouds
!                - better cloud fraction and subgrid scale mixing ratios.
!                - may experience a small cool bias during the daytime now that high 
!                  SW-down bias is greatly reduced...
!            Some tweaks to increase the turbulent mixing during the daytime for
!                bl_mynn_mixlength option 2 to alleviate cool bias (very small impact).
!            Improved ensemble spread from changes to SPP in MYNN
!                - now perturbing eddy diffusivity and eddy viscosity directly
!                - now perturbing background rh (in SGS cloud calc only)
!                - now perturbing entrainment rates in mass-flux scheme
!            Added IF checks (within IFDEFS) to protect mixchem code from being used
!                when HRRR smoke is used (no impact on regular non-wrf chem use)
!            Important bug fix for wrf chem when transporting chemical species in MF scheme
!            Removed 2nd mass-flux scheme (no only bl_mynn_edmf = 1, no option 2)
!            Removed unused stochastic code for mass-flux scheme
!            Changed mass-flux scheme to be integrated on interface levels instead of
!                mass levels - impact is small
!            Added option to mix 2nd moments in MYNN as opposed to the scalar_pblmix option.
!                - activated with bl_mynn_mixscalars = 1; this sets scalar_pblmix = 0
!                - added tridagonal solver used in scalar_pblmix option to duplicate tendencies
!                - this alone changes the interface call considerably from v4.0.
!            Slight revision to TKE production due to radiation cooling at top of clouds
!            Added the non-Guassian buoyancy flux function of Bechtold and Siebesma (1998, JAS).
!                - improves TKE in SGS clouds
!            Added heating due to dissipation of TKE (small impact, maybe + 0.1 C daytime PBL temp)
!            Misc changes made for FV3/MPAS compatibility
! v4.2       A series of small tweaks to help reduce a cold bias in the PBL:
!                - slight increase in diffusion in convective conditions
!                - relaxed criteria for mass-flux activation/strength
!                - added capability to cycle TKE for continuity in hourly updating HRRR
!                - added effects of compensational environmental subsidence in mass-flux scheme,
!                  which resulted in tweaks to detrainment rates.
!            Bug fix for diagnostic-decay of SGS clouds - noticed by Greg Thompson. This has
!                a very small, but primarily  positive, impact on SW-down biases.
!            Tweak to calculation of KPBL - urged by Laura Fowler - to make more intuitive.
!            Tweak to temperature range of blending for saturation check (water to ice). This
!                slightly reduces excessive SGS clouds in polar region. No impact warm clouds. 
!            Added namelist option bl_mynn_output (0 or 1) to suppress or activate the
!                allocation and output of 10 3D variables. Most people will want this
!                set to 0 (default) to save memory and disk space.
!            Added new array qi_bl as opposed to using qc_bl for both SGS qc and qi. This
!                gives us more control of the magnitudes which can be confounded by using
!                a single array. As a results, many subroutines needed to be modified,
!                especially mym_condensation.
!            Added the blending of the stratus component of the SGS clouds to the mass-flux
!                clouds to account for situations where stratus and cumulus may exist in the
!                grid cell.
!            Misc small-impact bugfixes:
!                1) dz was incorrectly indexed in mym_condensation
!                2) configurations with icloud_bl = 0 were using uninitialized arrays
!
!            Many of these changes are now documented in Olson et al. (2019,
!                NOAA Technical Memorandum)

! Mixing Length Options 
!   specifed through namelist:  bl_mynn_mixlength
!   added:  16 Apr 2015
!
! 0: Uses original MYNN mixing length formulation (except elt is calculated from 
!    a 10-km vertical integration).  No scale-awareness is applied to the master
!    mixing length (el), regardless of "scaleaware" setting. 
!
! 1 (*DEFAULT*): Instead of (0), uses BouLac mixing length in free atmosphere.  
!    This helps remove excessively large mixing in unstable layers aloft.  Scale-
!    awareness in dx is available via the "scaleaware" setting.  As of Apr 2015, 
!    this mixing length formulation option is used in the ESRL RAP/HRRR configuration.
!
! 2: As in (1), but elb is lengthened using separate cloud mixing length functions 
!    for statically stable and unstable regimes.  This elb adjustment is only 
!    possible for nonzero cloud fractions, such that cloud-free cells are treated 
!    as in (1), but BouLac calculation is used more sparingly - when elb > 500 m. 
!    This is to reduce the computational expense that comes with the BouLac calculation.
!    Also, This option is  scale-aware in dx if "scaleaware" = 1. (Following Ito et al. 2015).

    !---------------------------------------------------------------
    !             NOTES ON THE PBLH FORMULATION
    !
    !The 1.5-theta-increase method defines PBL heights as the level at 
    !which the potential temperature first exceeds the minimum potential 
    !temperature within the boundary layer by 1.5 K. When applied to 
    !observed temperatures, this method has been shown to produce PBL-
    !height estimates that are unbiased relative to profiler-based 
    !estimates (Nielsen-Gammon et al. 2008). However, their study did not
    !include LLJs. Banta and Pichugina (2008) show that a TKE-based 
    !threshold is a good estimate of the PBL height in LLJs. Therefore,
    !a hybrid definition is implemented that uses both methods, weighting
    !the TKE-method more during stable conditions (PBLH < 400 m).
    !A variable tke threshold (TKEeps) is used since no hard-wired
    !value could be found to work best in all conditions.

! Dynamic Multi-Plume (DMP) Mass-Flux Scheme
!
! Much thanks to Kay Suslj of NASA-JPL for contributing the original version
! of this mass-flux scheme. Considerable changes have been made from it's
! original form. Some additions include:
!  1) scale-aware tapering as dx -> 0
!  2) transport of TKE (extra namelist option)
!  3) Chaboureau-Bechtold cloud fraction & coupling to radiation (when icloud_bl > 0)
!  4) some extra limits for numerical stability
! This scheme remains under development, so consider it experimental code.
